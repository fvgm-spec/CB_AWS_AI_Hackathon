## AWS_CB_AI_Hackathon

This is the ever first AWS Community Builders (CBs) Hackathon launched in June 2023. This is a fantastic opportunity for all CBs to learn, be craetive and to create something remarkable!

The Hackathon circles around **Transformer-Tools**. This is also called **The Transformer-Tool-Hackathon**

The Transformer Tools Hackathon is a virtual event open to all skill levels and running from June 1 to June 30. Whether you're a seasoned AI practitioner, an avid coder, or a curious beginner, we welcome your participation and are excited to see what you create! We welcome solo submissions or teams up to 4 people (for more information about team organization, judging criteria and examples in the thread :thread:). We will also have prizes for the top projects!! :money_with_wings:

## What is the Hackathon challenge?
Your challenge is to create a tool using the [Transformer Tools](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/transformers_agents) framework. The tool can be anything that solves a problem or adds value in a creative way. The more innovative and useful, the better! You can submit as team up to 4 people or have a solo submission.


:alphabet-yellow-question: “What are Transformer Tools?”
Transformer Tools is a powerful framework for building and deploying AI models. They can be used to create interactive tools that perform a wide variety of tasks, from resume building, language translation, and sentiment analysis, to more complex tasks like creating websites and AWS Lambda functions. The possibilities are truly endless!
:bulb: Sample Categories
To help guide your brainstorming process, we've provided a few categories for the kind of tools you can build:
Educational Tools: Could be a tool that makes complex topics more understandable, like a math problem solver or a language learning assistant.
Productivity Tools: Think about tools that could help enhance productivity. This could be a task manager, a document summarizer, or an automated scheduler.
Entertainment Tools: Here you can let your imagination run wild. Create a tool that writes poetry, generates music, or even creates custom video game characters.
Data Analysis Tools: For those who love working with data, you could create a tool that performs complex data analysis, generates reports, or visualizes data in a unique way.
Remember, these are just ideas to get you started. We encourage you to think outside the box and create a tool that reflects your interests and passions. We know everyone is so creative and are really looking forward to seeing everyone’s projects!

:writing_hand: Submitting your entry - Blog Post Submission
Along with your tool, we're asking each group (or solo builder) to also submit a blog post (preferably on Dev.To) detailing their creation process. This blog post should include:
Introduction: Briefly describe the tool you built and what it does.
Motivation: What inspired you to create this tool? What problem does it solve?
Process: Explain the steps you took to create your tool. This could include brainstorming, coding, testing, and any challenges you faced along the way.
Outcome: Discuss the end result. How does your tool work? How can others use it? Link to the code
Reflection: What did you learn from this process? How will you apply this experience in the future?
We believe this blog post component will not only help you reflect on what you've learned but also provide valuable insights for other participants and the broader AI community.
Starting June 1 we will share a form for you that will be open until June 30. This form is how you will submit your Team name (or solo name), your tool (GH repo or similar) and your blog post.
